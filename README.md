# 🌱 AgriScan AI

### Distributed Agricultural Monitoring Platform

AgriScan AI is a **smart agricultural monitoring system** that combines **computer vision, machine learning, and geospatial analysis** to detect crop diseases and monitor epidemic outbreaks in agricultural regions.

The platform allows farmers, researchers, and agricultural technicians to **analyze crop images, identify diseases, and visualize outbreaks on a regional map**.

## 🚀 Features

### 🌿 Crop Image Analysis

* Upload or capture images of crop leaves.
* AI-powered classification using a trained **ResNet18 deep learning model**.
* Identifies:

  * Crop type
  * Plant diseases
  * Background detection
* Displays prediction confidence.

---

### 🤖 Agronomic Virtual Assistant

* Interactive assistant to answer agricultural questions.
* Provides recommendations about:

  * Crop diseases
  * Prevention methods
  * Treatments and best practices.

---

### 🗺️ Epidemiological Map

Interactive map for **monitoring crop disease outbreaks**.

Features include:
